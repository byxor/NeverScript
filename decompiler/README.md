# Warning

:warning: :warning: :warning:

I've temporarily removed the decompiler from the repository.

## Reasoning

*   The decompiler is using old syntax.
*   The decompiler is decreasing the test coverage (and codecov.io hates it)
*   The decompiler is a little unclean.

## Old Decompiler

You can find the old version here in a [previous commit](https://github.com/byxor/NeverScript/tree/251ae85830b39f856ab76ef984b97e5f753762be/decompiler).

## What to expect

Don't expect anything soon. The compiler is the main focus for now, since we can port decompiled roq to neverscript by hand.
Personally, this is good enough for the majority of my usecases.

Kind regards,
Byxor.
