# Warning :warning: :warning: :warning:

I've temporarily removed the decompiler from the repository.

## Reasoning

*  The decompiler is using old syntax.
*  The decompiler is decreasing the test coverage (and codecov.io hates it)
*  The decompiler is a little unclean.

## Old Decompiler

You can find the old version here in a previous commit:

https://github.com/byxor/NeverScript/tree/251ae85830b39f856ab76ef984b97e5f753762be/decompiler

## What to expect

A cleaner decompiler will be introduced soon. Perhaps parsed by an LL grammar, similarly to the compiler.

Kind regards,
byxor.
