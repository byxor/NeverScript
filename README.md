# NeverScript

NeverScript is a programming language that targets Neversoft's custom scripting engine (QB).

**This project contains:**

* A `NeverScript -> QB` compiler.
* A `QB -> NeverScript` decompiler.

**These tools are intended to work with games such as:**

* Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (THPS3)
* Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 (THPS4)
* Tony Hawk's Underground (THUG/THUG1)
* Tony Hawk's Underground 2 (THUG2)
* Tony Hawk's Underground Pro (THUG Pro)
* Tony Hawk's American Wasteland (THAW)
* Guitar Hero III (GH3)

All of these games use variations of Neversoft's scripting engine. We are primarily targetting THUG2, but we aim to create a language that is somewhat compatible with multiple games.

## Work in progress

This project is a work in progress; many things are incomplete.

There's currently no way to run the tools, but the tests are executable. We plan to address this soon.
